## Question

Given a string s, which contains a mix of words and palindromes in it, write a function to get the length of the nth palindrome from the last.

## Conditions

1 <= n <= 100

## Example 1

Input string - "memory ordering in programs is often a complex area to deal with. malayalam and madam are palindromes. refer c++ books"

if n = 3,
Output = 9 for "malayalam"

if n = 1,
Output = 5 for "refer"

if n = 5,
Output = -1 because there is no palindrome at position 5

## Example 2

Input string - "hey i'm a no palindrome string"

if n = 3,
Output = -1 because there is no palindrome

## Pseudocode

func GetLengthOfNthPalindromeFromLast(s string) int {
// complete the function
}

## Notes

1. You could choose any of the following programming languages. C/C++ or Golang preferable.
   a. C/C++
   b. Golang
   c. Python
   d. Rust

2. Send the solution in a separate source code file, comment wherever neccessary.

3. We are looking at the progam correctness, modularity and design.

4. Write test cases to test the solution
